# Music_socket

This is a simple javascript web application that allows users to affect music together in real time. Users can add visual effect and audio effects to the music. The music is played on the server and the audio effects are applied on the server.

## Getting Started

### Server

To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name music_socket -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app node:current-alpine npm install
docker run -it --rm --name music_socket -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app -p 9090:9090 node:current-alpine node server.js
```

### Javascript Client

**NB change the IP address in the client.js file to the IP address of the server.**

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name client -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app node:current-alpine npm install
docker run -it --rm --name client -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app -p 8080:8080 node:current-alpine node client.js
```

#### Output

### Golang webserver

allows many users to connect to the server and send messages to the javascript server.

***NB change the IP address in the main.go file to the IP address of the server.***

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name golang -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app golang go run main.go
```

#### Output from a mobile client

Need to figure out how to sync the time between the server and the client. As using the time from the client is not accurate.
